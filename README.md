## Star Trek: The Final Frontier

## About me and this project
Hello, my name is Ilya Manyukhin. I live and work in Voronezh, Russia. If you speak any Russian language, you can find out more about me on my website - <a href="http://feblog.ru" target="_blank">feblog.ru.</a> If you don't know it, you can still visit the site, maybe you will find something to your taste.
I became interested in web development about four years ago. I started making my first sites and realized that the frontend was the most interesting to me.
I am actively studying javascript at the moment. I am really into this language and I want to keep developing in this direction.
This game was written by me in order to consolidate my knowledge. I hope you like it.

## How to install this application
If you want to install the app on your PC, you need to download the project files to your PC. Then you need to launch the console in the project folder and run the "npm i" command. After all the necessary modules are installed, you need to run the "gulp" command in the console to start the app.
The working directory is the "app" directory. You can change files in this directory and they will be automatically uploaded to the "public" directory.

## Live long and prosper!
